# Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Bernard
- ðŸ‘€ A recently graduated Computer Science student from ADNU, I am a passionate Unity Game Developer with two or more years of hands-on experience in creating immersive and engaging gaming experiences. I possess proficiency in a range of programming languages, including C++, Python, Java, and HTML.

- ðŸ‘€ Additionally, I have gained practical experience through internships at two companies. At NUECA, I served as a Quality Assurance Intern, meticulously testing their app, identifying bugs, and contributing to enhanced app functionality and user experience. During my time at ThingsPH, I collaborated with fellow interns on coding projects, which provided me with valuable hands-on experience in real-world software development scenarios.
